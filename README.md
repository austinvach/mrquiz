# Electronic Learning Game
Mr. Quiz is similar to the original [GeoSafari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoSafari), but better! It supports legacy GeoSafari content as well as brand new content that will soon be available for purchase.

## Project To-Dos
- [x] Create POC that reads from [Codes.h](Codes.h) and accepts input from the user.
- [ ] Randomize ordering of Q/A pairs at the start of a new game.
- [ ] Add option to toggle between GeoSafari mode and standard mode (GeoSafari mode question numbers are not sequential but map to the lights on the original unit).
- [ ] Add scoring (3 tries per question with fewer points awarded for each mistake).
- [ ] Allow user to specify the time to respond at the start of each game (adjust sleep timer accordingly).
- [ ] Add two player mode.
- [ ] Update [Codes.h](Codes.h) to include all known GeoSafari codes and the associated Q&A pairs.
- [ ] Enable deep sleep when disconnected from power during "pretend sleep".
